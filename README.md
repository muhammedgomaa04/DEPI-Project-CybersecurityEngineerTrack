# 📡 Secure Multi-Branch Office Network (DEPI Graduation Project)

A hands-on graduation project under the **Digital Egypt Pioneers Initiative (DEPI)**.  
The objective was to **design, implement, and secure** a simulated enterprise network interconnecting a main office with multiple branches using **Cisco technologies**.

---

## 🛠️ Project Overview

This project simulates a real-world enterprise network setup, focusing on:

- 🏢 Branch interconnectivity via VPN
- 🔐 VLAN segmentation
- 🚦 Routing protocols (OSPF with Authentication)
- 🔒 Site-to-site IPsec VPN
- 📜 Firewall rules & ACLs
- 🛡️ Security hardening and protection techniques

---

## 🧩 Network Architecture

- **Main Office** + **3 Branches** (HR, Finance, Sales)
- Interconnected over a **public network using IPsec VPN**
- Internal segmentation with **VLANs & Inter-VLAN Routing**
- **OSPF** for dynamic routing with authentication
- Multiple **security layers** including ACLs, firewall rules, and IDS/IPS
